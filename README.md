This is the main product of my school project. The product is a interactive presentation in a web-page, showing user the hardware of a personal computer.

The presentation can be found [here](https://yarishe.github.io/schoolProject/).

If you click on one of the parts of the PC, a window with a small description, Wikipedia article link, and sometimes, with an illustration image will appear. 

**Warning**: the text there is in the Russian language only.

In addition, some of the parts have detailed view. Also, the cooler can be removed from the motherboard, so you can find the central processor under it.

**Warning**: the web-page is not mobile friendly.
